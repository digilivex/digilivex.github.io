While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=rubik039s-cube-animation--the-goal-was-to-make-an-animation-o--flickr-1>Rubik's Cube Animation | The Goal Was To Make An Animation O… | Flickr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rubik039s-cube-animation--the-goal-was-to-make-an-animation-o--flickr-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3541/3404608021_7519b2be2e_m.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.HFmsIwMonPDEHDFxF-DfOwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Rubik's cube animation | The goal was to make an animation o… | Flickr"><p><em>Source: flickr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpapers for different devices:
