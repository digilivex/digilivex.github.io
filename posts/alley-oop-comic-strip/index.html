-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=the-inside-oop-how-newton-native-became-comic-strip-character--newton>The Inside Oop: How Newton Native Became Comic Strip Character – Newton<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-inside-oop-how-newton-native-became-comic-strip-character--newton>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.newtondailynews.com/resizer/EiVrECq_7lkgECj1hoVSC8p3Czo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/VP7XE32WRBG4NJ4ATJHSIHBG5E.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-_Nkb8wLBZoVGM6iK3Ay_AHaD4&pid=15.1"' alt="The Inside Oop: How Newton native became comic strip character – Newton"><p><em>Source: newtondailynews.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What are wallpaper screens and why are they so popular?
